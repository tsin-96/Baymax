- Terror held me like a vice-like grip
- The torture of my indecision and fear threatened to crush me
- Those death-like eyes, devoid of all emotions...
- Like the cold breath of a grave, her words seemed to cut my very soul.
- I was strickened into silence
- A ghastly whiteness spread over her face.
- His face a frozen in a glassy state of horror
- I stared at the corpse with a grim and shuddering fascination
- An uncomfortable premonition of fear pervaded his senses
